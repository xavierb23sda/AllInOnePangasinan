                    <h1>Language</h1>
                    <p>At least three dialects are used by Pangasinenses to communicate. Pangasinan, Tagalog, and Ilokano are these. Both Ilokano and Pangasinan are frequently used in the northern Pangasinan municipalities. Municipalities located in the South and East, however, frequently speak Ilocano rather than Pangasinan. Pangasinan is more frequently used in western municipalities than any other dialect. Age-wise, older people are more at ease speaking Pangasinan and Ilokano than younger people, who prefer Tagalog as their primary language of communication.<br><br>
                        Schools, hospitals, government organizations, and commercial enterprises like to conduct daily business in both Tagalog and Pangasinan. Although Pangasinan is the official dialect of the Pangasinenses, it is rumored that fewer and fewer individuals, particularly the younger generation, are utilizing it. One explanation is the way in which pupils are instructed in schools, where the use of English and Filipino is not only strongly enforced but also promoted. Also, the younger generation has a culture of discriminating against and demeaning those who speak the regional dialects because they signify that a person is "from the ghetto" or comes from a lower social level.<br><br>
                        Younger people, especially the youth, are embarrassed to speak their native languages because of this stigma and only use Tagalog to fit in with their peer groups. Well, it makes me very sad since Pangasinan is an important part of who we are as Pangasinenses. Without it, we are essentially eliminating a component of our humanity. We can stop this identity from quickly deteriorating if we only address this and take more delight in utilizing our own tongue.</p>
