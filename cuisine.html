                        <h2>Dagupan Bangus</h2>
                        <p>What makes this bangus (en. Milkfish) different from other bangus in the country? They are the hybrid type. Most milkfishes are freshwater species, but at the Dagupan, they are bred at saltwater by the Lingayen gulf. Being bred at sea, they have a different taste, more saltier and lesser stench (lansa) than the other. These fishes are great for grilled cooking or fried (boneless bangus) or being added as a meat supplement for one of their other dish called pakbet.</p>

                        <h2>Pakbet</h2>
                        <p>Similar to pinakbet which is an Ilocano dish. Although they mostly do not differ and exactly the same. Pangasinan is the nearest province of the Ilocos Region in reference to the capital, Metro Manila, yet because it is still Ilocos, they do have almost the same dishes. If you are in Ilocos and Tagalog, this dish is usually called "pinakbet". But in Pangasinan, usually this is "Pakbet". It is a dish of mixed vegetables you commonly hear in the Filipino song "Bahay Kubo". But Pakbet Pangasinan has more sauce (sabaw) than that of Ilocos and the soup is made more tastier by Bagoong isda (fish paste) instead of those the Ilocanos use which are usually fish sauce (patis) and alamang (made of krill). Pakbet is also mixed up with meat, either pork, beef or milkfish (bangus).</p>

                        <h2>Bagoong Isda</h2>
                        <p>This is fish paste which is made up of fermented fish. More often used as food spice but also used as a dish on impoverished areas. Raw small fishes (anchovies) are placed in a large cooking pot, seasoned with salt, vinegar and a little chilly. Preserved for a day without cooking and have itself be fermented by salt. Crushed a bit so the fish taste mixes up with the thick sauce via osmosis. Then sold in bottles. It has a stench unbearable to some people however mixing this up to sour foods such as raw mangoes or to add taste to pakbet makes the dish tastes awesome.</p>

                        <p>Distinct for its mildly salty and garlic taste, a Filipino sausage stuffed with meaty pork, a bit of its fat, colored distinctively red with azuete and wrapped with pork intenstines. Originated from Alaminos, Pangasinan but can bought at any marketplace in Pangasinan</p>

                        <p>This is the Pangasinan equivalent of papaitan made up of goat innards but unlike papaitan, they can either use goat or pig innards. The innards are cooked in boiling water and sauteed to taste. Animal fat (sebo) is also mixed once the soup is hot.</p>

                        <p>This is the Pangasinan equivalent of dinuguan but the difference is that it is cooked similarly to Kaleskesan. It is made up of either goat or pig innards, boiled in water, sauteed to taste. Then cubes of dried pork or goat blood is minced and added.</p>

                        <p>This natural dark chocolate that came directly from crushed dried cocoa seeds has always been my favorite morning drink every breakfast. Back then when my grandma still prepares this way back when I was just a toddler.</p>

                        <h2>Tupig</h2>
                        <p>It is a rice cake with coconut meat strips and grilled while it is wrapped in banana leaves. Also sold in Tarlac but its original version originates from Socony, Pangasinan. Noted for its smoked and sweet taste.</p>

                        <h2>Calasiao Puto and Kutsinta</h2>
                        <p>By its name, it can be bought at Calasiao, Pangasinan. Both are rice cakes. Puto is made up of the juice that comes out when rice is grinded with water and is boiled to become a cake. While kutsinta is similar to puto except that it has more flour than rice then food coloring is added so it would look dark orange. They are also served in smaller servings (about and inch in diameter) and is usually tastier than other non-Pangasinan variants. </p>
